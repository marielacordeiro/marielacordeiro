I'm a student currently in the 5th semester of Software Engineering at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS).

I currently work remotely at Dell Technologies as a Full Stack Engineer in a global team, solving problems and creating new software tools for the company with active participation in many projects using different technologies such as .NET, ASP.NET Core, Angular.js, Python.

I have a strong interest in technology and innovation, especially when it comes to using creativity and cooperation to solve problems. My goal is to continue learning and perfecting new skills in my academic background, seeking more practical and theoretical experience in these areas.
